# NeoVim
# --------
# Is a refactor, and sometimes redactor, in the tradition of Vim 
# (which itself derives from Stevie). It is not a rewrite but a continuation 
# and extension of Vim. Many clones and derivatives exist, some very 
# clever—but none are Vim. Neovim is built for users who want the good 
# parts of Vim, and more.
# 
brew install neovim
